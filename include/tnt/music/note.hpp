\brief Represents a musical note

This class represents musical note data. It provides a method for storing and retrieving information
about musical notes. Note objects are created byproviding the frequency of the note. Attributes of
the Note object are calculated from the equations given on the
<a href="http://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/NoteFreqCalcs.html">Physics of Music - Notes</a> page. f0 (the
reference frequency used to calculate the values of all notes) is 440 by default, but a custom value
for f0 can be specified when creating a Note object. Currently only the standard 12-tone equal
temperament note system used in most Western music is supported.
