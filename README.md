# Overview

cpp-music is an open source, cross platform, C++ library for storing and
analyzing musical data

## Documentation

The available functions are documented with Doxygen style comments in the C++
header files. For now the easiest way to view the documentation is by simply
opening the header files and reading the comments, but I plan on finding a way
to actually build and formally publish the documentation in the near future.

# Build Instructions

cpp-music can be built as a standalone CMake project.

    cmake -H. -Bbuild
    cmake --build build

To test the project, run CTest from the build directory.

    cd build
